# **GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA)**
**Inspired by natural evolution, GAs efficiently explore the solution space to discover optimal or near-optimal solutions, even for complex problems with multiple moving parts. By mimicking the process of natural selection, GAs can evolve solutions over time, improving their performance iteratively. The natural selection process is mirrored in GA by selecting individuals with higher fitness scores for reproduction. In this way, they pass on their favorable traits, or "genes," to the next generation. Potential solutions to a problem are represented as "chromosomes," which are typically coded as strings or arrays. Each element in the chromosome corresponds to a gene that determines a specific trait of the solution. Crossover is a genetic operation that combines parts of the genetic material of two parent chromosomes into a new chromosome that has parts of each parent. Mutation introduces random changes to an organism's genes, which can lead to new traits. A fitness function evaluates how well a solution solves the problem at hand. Solutions with higher fitness scores are more likely to be selected for reproduction, ensuring that better solutions propagate through generations.**
##### **This notebook shows an practical implementation of this algorithm. Genetic algorithm will be used to find the combination of values for a, b, and c that results in the flattest parabola of the equation y=ax2+bx+c.**
